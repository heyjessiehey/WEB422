# web422_a3 knockout.js
Bootstrap (3), jQuery, Knockout (and the "mapping" plugin), and a jQuery Plugin - "Multiple Select"
 
Creating a friendly user interface to allow users to edit existing team data. This includes changing the Team Lead, the current Projects as well as the Members (Employees) of each of the 15 teams in the system. We will use a "panel" driven interface provided by Bootstrap 3.3.7 to organize the form controls (<select> elements) for each team. A jQuery Plugin will be used to make the controls much easier to use, and Knockout.js will provide two-way binding for quick updates.
